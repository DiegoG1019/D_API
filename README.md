# D_API

D_API is a personal project to practice API building, security, authorization and serving

I'll be using it primarily for some of my own applications where I'd like certain configuration or other information to be readily available from a central, trusted location (and with known disk permanence, as opposed to some projects)

## Installation
The installation process is much like any other ASP.NET API Project: Set up a reverse proxy, open up the firewall and run the thing

## Usage

_W.I.P._

## Contributing
